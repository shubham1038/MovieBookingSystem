Technologies recommended
•	Language -Java and other add-on languages
•	Frameworks- Any
•	Database - Any

•	Cloud technologies- Any
•	Preferred editor to build and present solution

PS: The given exercise will help you get prepared for technical discussion and demonstrate your current understanding on key architectural artifacts. It’s expected that you may not all sections hence can ignore them. 

Evaluation criteria
•	Code artifacts (APIs Contract, Design Patterns, Any one Scenario Implementation)
•	Design principles to address functional requirement and non-functional requirement
•	DB & Data model
•	Platform solutions detailing
•	Solution completeness, presentation, and discussion.
•	Solution coverage uniqueness and extensibility.

Note: Incomplete solution component would be discussed during discussion round. All sections are not mandatory.
You can skip solution areas that you are not comfortable by making a note of it.
